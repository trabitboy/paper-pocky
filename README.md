# paper-pocky
2d game engine in the style of p#cky and r#cky games; loads assets from image files without any retouch,
completely rewritten from the squirrel example game
( you might recognize the bounciness, but that s all that's left :)  )

no touched up asset
target is full paper / photo to engine
